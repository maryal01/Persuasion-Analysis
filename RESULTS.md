# Results

Test-set results for each trained model. Each row is one training run; add new rows as runs finish.

## T1: CMV persuasion (`cmv`)

Test set: 1,019 delta/no-delta pairs (2,038 replies) from posts that never appear in training
(dataset branch `t1-t2`). The main metric is **pairwise accuracy**: how often the model scores the
delta reply above its no-delta partner. Chance is 50%.

| Model | Pairwise acc. | AUROC | Accuracy | F1 (delta) | Macro-F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Coin flip | 50.0% | 0.500 | – | – | – |
| More comments wins | 53.7% | – | – | – | – |
| More links wins | 54.3% | – | – | – | – |
| Longer reply wins | 55.3% | – | – | – | – |
| **ModernBERT-base, text only** | **66.1%** | **0.629** | 55.9% | 0.645 | 0.532 |

- Model: [`nlp-final-project11/nlp-project-modernbert-cmv`](https://huggingface.co/nlp-final-project11/nlp-project-modernbert-cmv)
  (private). Trained on Gilbreth (one A100, ~1h45m, Slurm job 12026112), 3 epochs, max 4,096 tokens.
- With 1,019 pairs, pairwise accuracy has a rough 95% interval of ±3 points (about 63–69%).
- Single-reply accuracy is low because the model labels 74% of replies "delta" (precision 0.54,
  recall 0.80). Its ranking is better than its yes/no cutoff, which is why the pairwise score is higher.
- No delta markers ("Δ", "!delta") leak into the replies: they appear in under 0.5% of replies on either side.

**Caveats**
- One run, one random seed. Final numbers should average a few seeds.
- This run picked its checkpoint by validation F1 (step 1000, validation AUROC 0.630). Later
  checkpoints had higher validation AUROC (0.644). The code now selects by AUROC.
- Text only. Audience features (RQ2) haven't been added yet.

**Prior work.** Al-Khatib et al. (ACL 2020), who built Webis-CMV-20, report per-comment accuracy
rather than pairwise: word count 51.9%, Tan et al.'s best text features 57.8%, their model with
debater traits 61.1%. Their metric differs from ours, so don't compare the numbers directly.
Tan et al. (2016)'s 65.1% is on a different corpus.

## T2: DDO voter switching (`ddo_switch`, `ddo_undecided`)

Not trained yet.
